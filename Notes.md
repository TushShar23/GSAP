```

> GSAP is a JS animation library.It is used to make complex animations for the frontend.Gsap stands for GREEN SOCK ANIMATION PLATFORM.
> We can use GSAP after importing/linking it through CDN.
> GSAP METHODS : 

to() = Changes/moves/modify properties of an element TO some values.(intial properties to final properties)
from() = Starts animation FROM the given properties to DEFAULT VALUES.(final properties to initial properties)

ex- gsap.to("element id/class",{
properties.....
})

gsap.from("element id/class",{
properties.....
})

**** DURATION : is the time taken by an element to reach its final state.
**** DELAY : is the time after which ANIMATION STARTS

> We can add CSS PROPERTIES in the methods but we have to use CAMELCASE for properties name and ("")commas for specifying the values.
